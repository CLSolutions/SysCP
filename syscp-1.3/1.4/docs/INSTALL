INSTALLATION
All these instruction must be executed as root in your bash. 

1.) Download the current SysCP developer version
	> svn export http://svn.syscp.org/trunk/syscp-1.3/ /usr/local/syscp
	
2.) Create the symbolic link for the new bash application
	> ln -s /usr/local/syscp/sbin/syscp /usr/sbin/syscp
	
3.) Configure SysCP
	> syscp configure

4.) Install the database, please note, any existing database with the name
    you set in 'configure' will be deleted. 
	> syscp install 
	
5.) Try if there are pending upgrades
	> syscp upgrade 
	
	NOTE: Steps 3-5 can be done in one huge step by calling: 
	> syscp configure install upgrade 

6.) Add an Alias to the default vhost, by adding the following two lines to your
    default vhost of apache2 (debian: /etc/apache2/sites-available/default)

		Alias /syscp /usr/local/syscp/htdocs
		php_admin_value open_basedir "/usr/local/syscp"
		
7.) Restart apache
	> /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
	
8.) You're done.
