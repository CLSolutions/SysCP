# GENERIC MODULE PART

# The name of the module, only alphanumerical chars and
# underscore are allowed, no space!

###
# NAVIGATION ENTRIES
#
# Here you can put the entries, which you need in the navigation menu. All keys must
# start with Navigation, the second keypart is only a counter, PLEASE NOTE, don't use
# numerical counter, like [0..9] here. Due to a silly decision made by the developers
# of array_merge_recursive, numerical indices get renumbered instead of merged.
